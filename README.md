Working with text, language and RiTa.js

## Notes:
- From the moment I realised we were going to be downloading new fonts to insert into our code I knew that I wanted to experiment with using hieroglyphics.
- I found browsing for fonts really entertaining, and although I knew it would be more difficult to use less intelligible fonts I really like the idea of turning the user's text into a kind of new code for them to try to understand.
- I ended up using two separate fonts in the code as I realised we would be implementing RiTa and I couldn't just use the first font which is completely unreadable as that would defeat the purpose of using RiTa's functions in the first place. I needed another font that I could use for atleast half of the text so I chose another Egyptian style font off of the website https://www.fontspace.com/category/hieroglyphs
- I made it so that RiTa would generate a sentence similar to the one that the user inputs, however her one is readable as a "reply" of sorts, whereas the user's words are translated into hieroglyphs.
- I like the idea that font can be utikised to create a pattern that isn't actually letters as such. The idea that each keyboard letter can have a completely dispirate icon attached to it that you could creat a new language with is interesting to me.
- I added a clear button to make it more user friendly, and also added a shortcut of linking the return/enter key to the button so that people could enter their sentence faster.

## Setbacks / Problems:
- I had trouble first with using the hieroglyphics fonts as the original one I wanted to use (downloaded off of google.fonts) did not properly work in the code. I still don't really know why but I tried downloading another font from the fontspace site and that worked without much change to the original code.
- I found it quite tedious to position the text/button/poem etc on the screen as I really like using "windowWidth, windowHeight" constraints for the canvas, yet this makes it difficult to positon everything as the constraints can change.
- I had trouble also with the spacing between the lines of text, but quickly sorted that.
